'''Here we are going to do positive indexing and find out the item in the list 

Positive indexing starts from 0 upto the of item in the list 

For example, here I have taken a list which is [34,98,'A',6.5]

Here the positive indexing of the list is : 
           Items : 34  98   A    6.5
Positive Indexing: 0   1    2     3
'''

list=[23 , 'A' , 'Hello World' , 45.89]
print(list[0])
print(list[1])
print(list[2])
print(list[3])
